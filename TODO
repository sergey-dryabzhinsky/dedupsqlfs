Here are some things on to-do list, in no particular order:

 * Implement functions for work with blocks, hashes, subvolumes as semarate
   commands (options) in do.dedupsqlfs. This should reduce code size of
   FUSE operations file.

 * Automatically switch to a larger block size to reduce the overhead for files
   that rarely change after being created (like >= 100MB video files :-)
   Or use defragmentation tool for that.
   Also different block size for every file.

 * Implement rename() independently of link()/unlink() to improve performance?
   Need benchmarks.

 * Implement `--verify-reads` option that recalculates hashes when reading to
   check for data block corruption?

 * Implement `--verify-writes` option that recalculates hashes when writing to
   check for data block corruption? (dropped by Sergey while porting to pythno3)

 * Tag databases with a version number and implement automatic upgrades because
   I've grown tired of upgrading my database by hand :-)

 * Support directory hard links without upsetting FUSE and add a command-line
   option that instructs `dedupfs.py` to search for identical subdirectories
   and replace them with directory hard links.
